packages are Copyright 2008 SQL Power Group Inc. All rights reserved.

The Architect relies on a number of third-party libraries, most
of which are bundled with both the source and binary distributions.
We redistribute those libraries under their own licensing terms,

Linking Power*Architect statically or dynamically with other modules
is making a combined work based on Power*Architect.  Thus, the terms

combination.

In addition, as a special exception, SQL Power gives you permission to
combine Power*Architect program with free software programs or
libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with the standard
releases of the JavaBeans(TM) Activation Framework (JAF), JavaHelp(TM),
and JavaMail (TM) reference implementations from Sun Microsystems, Inc. 
(or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license). You may 
copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for 
Power*Architect and the licenses of the other code concerned.

As an additional special exception, SQL Power gives you permission to
use Power*Architect together with publicly available JDBC drivers
whether or not they are licensed compatibly with the GPL.

As a final special exception, SQL Power gives you permission to use
Power*Architect together with any release of the JUnit test
framework, which is licensed under the Common Public License (CPL).

Note that people who make modified versions of Power*Architect are
not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified
versions; it is their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General Public
License gives permission to release a modified version without this
exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a modified
version which carries forward this exception.
