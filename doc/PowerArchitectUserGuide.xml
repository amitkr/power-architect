			<title>About Power*Architect</title>

			<para>
				Power*Architect from SQL Power Group is a visual data
				modeling tool designed for data architects, DBAs,
				analysts, designers, and other professionals. Quickly
				design every aspect of your data model using diagrams
				and a hierarchical view of your model structure. Your
				data model remains platform-independent, allowing you to
				maintain a single database schema that works well with
				multiple database platforms.
			</para>

			<para>
				Power*Architect is also well-suited to data warehouse
				and data mart design. You can open multiple source
				databases concurrently, then drag and drop objects (such
				as schemas, tables, and columns) into Power*Architect's
				data modeling playpen to create a new model. After
				fine-tuning the data model in the playpen, you can
				forward engineer the data model into new database on
				platforms such as Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, PostgreSQL,
				or MySQL. Power*Architect also creates ETL (Extract,
				Transform, Load) procedures you can use with Pentaho's
				popular open source Kettle ETL tool to populate the new
				database.
			</para>

			<para>
				Power*Architect provides you with a variety of tools to
				view and compare data structures and mappings. For
				example, you can compare the structure of any two
				databases, highlighting the differences and similarities
				and generating the required DDL to synchronize them. You
				can also create a visual mapping report listing the
				source tables used in your data model, or create a
				profile of the data contained in a database.
			</para>

			<para>
				Whether you're building or maintaining a data model,
				Power*Architect provides the tools to help you design
				your model in a fraction of the time.
			</para>

			<title>About This Guide</title>

			<para>
				The Power*Architect User Guide provides step-by-step
				instructions for using Power*Architect and covers all of
				Power*Architect's features and capabilities.
			</para>

			<para>
				The guide assumes you are familiar with basic database
				operations and terminology (please refer to "<xref linkend="glossary"/>"
				for a list of some common database terms). If you plan
				to use Kettle jobs, the guide assumes you have some
				knowledge about ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)
				procedures. If you are looking for more information
				about ETL, two books you may want to try are
				<emphasis>Building the Data Warehouse</emphasis>
				by W. H. Inmon and

					The Data Warehouse Toolkit: The Complete Dimensional
					Modeling

					prominent notices stating that You changed the
					files; and

					patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the
					Source form of the Work, excluding those notices
					that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative
					Works; and

					(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as
					part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works
					that You distribute must include a readable copy of
					the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE
					file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
					any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of
					the following places: within a NOTICE text file
					distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within
					the Source form or documentation, if provided along
					with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
					generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever
					such third-party notices normally appear. The
					contents of the NOTICE file are for informational
					purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
					add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
					Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
					addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
					that such additional attribution notices cannot be
					construed as modifying the License.

					You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
					modifications and may provide additional or
					different license terms and conditions for use,
					reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications,
					or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
					provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of
					the Work otherwise complies with the conditions
					stated in this License.

					5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You
					explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution
					intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by
					You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and
					conditions of this License, without any additional

					executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

					6. Trademarks. This License does not grant
					permission to use the trade names, trademarks,
					service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
					except as required for reasonable and customary use
					in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing
					the content of the NOTICE file.

					7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by
					applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
					provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
					Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
					WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express
					or implied, including, without limitation, any
					warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
					MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
					PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
					the appropriateness of using or redistributing the
					Work and assume any risks associated with Your
					exercise of permissions under this License.

					8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no
					legal theory, whether in tort (including
					negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required
					by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
					negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any
					Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
					any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
					consequential damages of any character arising as a
					result of this License or out of the use or
					inability to use the Work (including but not limited
					to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
					computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
					other commercial damages or losses), even if such
					Contributor has been advised of the possibility of
					such damages.

					9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
					redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof,
					You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
					acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
					liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
					this License. However, in accepting such
					obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and
					on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
					other Contributor, and only if You agree to
					indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
					harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
					asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
					accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

					have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1)
					Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions
					thereof); and 2) the combination of Modifications
					made by that Contributor with its Contributor
					Version (or portions of such combination).

					(c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and
					2.2(b) are effective on the date Contributor first
					makes Commercial Use of the Covered Code.

					(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent
					license is granted: 1) for any code that Contributor
					has deleted from the Contributor Version; 2)
					separate from the Contributor Version; 3) for
					infringements caused by: i) third party
					modifications of Contributor Version or ii) the
					combination of Modifications made by that
					Contributor with other software (except as part of
					the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4)
					under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Code in the
					absence of Modifications made by that Contributor.

					3. Distribution Obligations.

					3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which
					You create or to which You contribute are governed
					by the terms of this License, including without
					limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of
					Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms
					of this License or a future version of this License
					released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
					copy of this License with every copy of the Source
					Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
					terms on any Source Code version that alters or
					restricts the applicable version of this License or
					the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
					include an additional document offering the
					additional rights described in Section 3.5.

					3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification
					which You create or to which You contribute must be
					made available in Source Code form under the terms
					of this License either on the same media as an
					Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
					Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
					Executable version available; and if made available
					via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain
					available for at least twelve (12) months after the
					date it initially became available, or at least six
					(6) months after a subsequent version of that
					particular Modification has been made available to
					such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
					that the Source Code version remains available even
					if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
					maintained by a third party.

					3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause
					all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
					a file documenting the changes You made to create
					that Covered Code and the date of any change. You
					must include a prominent statement that the
					Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
					from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer
					and including the name of the Initial Developer in
					(a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
					Executable version or related documentation in which
					You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
					Code.

					3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party
					Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license
					under a third party's intellectual property rights
					is required to exercise the rights granted by such
					Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
					must include a text file with the Source Code
					distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the
					claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
					detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
					If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
					Modification is made available as described in
					Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the
					LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
					thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
					notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
					reasonably calculated to inform those who received
					the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
					obtained.

					(b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications
					include an application programming interface and
					Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
					are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
					Contributor must also include this information in
					the LEGAL file.

					(c) Representations. Contributor represents that,
					except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
					above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
					Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
					and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant
					the rights conveyed by this License.

					3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice
					in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it
					is not possible to put such notice in a particular
					Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
					include such notice in a location (such as a
					relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
					look for such a notice. If You created one or more
					Modification(s) You may add your name as a
					Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.
					You must also duplicate this License in any
					documentation for the Source Code where You describe
					recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
					Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge
					a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
					obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
					Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
					behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
					or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
					clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
					liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
					You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
					and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
					the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
					result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
					terms You offer.

					3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may
					distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
					the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
					for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
					stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
					Code is available under the terms of this License,
					including a description of how and where You have
					fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
					must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
					Executable version, related documentation or
					collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
					relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
					Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
					rights under a license of Your choice, which may
					contain terms different from this License, provided
					that You are in compliance with the terms of this
					License and that the license for the Executable
					version does not attempt to limit or alter the
					recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
					the rights set forth in this License. If You
					distribute the Executable version under a different
					license You must make it absolutely clear that any
					terms which differ from this License are offered by
					You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
					Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
					Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
					liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
					Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

					3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by
					combining Covered Code with other code not governed
					by the terms of this License and distribute the
					Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
					must make sure the requirements of this License are
					fulfilled for the Covered Code.

					4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

					If it is impossible for You to comply with any of
					the terms of this License with respect to some or
					all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
					order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
					the terms of this License to the maximum extent
					possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the
					code they affect. Such description must be included
					in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
					be included with all distributions of the Source
					Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
					regulation, such description must be sufficiently
					detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
					able to understand it.

					5. Application of this License.

					This License applies to code to which the Initial
					Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and
					to related Covered Code.

					6. Versions of the License.

					6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications
					Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or
					new versions of the License from time to time. Each
					version will be given a distinguishing version
					number.

					6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has
					been published under a particular version of the
					License, You may always continue to use it under the
					terms of that version. You may also choose to use
					such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
					version of the License published by Netscape. No one
					other than Netscape has the right to modify the
					terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
					License.

					6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a
					modified version of this License (which you may only
					do in order to apply it to code which is not already
					Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
					rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla",
					"MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or
					any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
					license (except to note that your license differs
					from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
					that Your version of the license contains terms
					which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
					Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the
					Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in
					the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
					themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
					License.)

					7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

					COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN
					"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
					EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
					WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
					MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
					NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
					AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
					SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
					RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
					CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
					SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
					WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
					LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
					HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

					8. TERMINATION.

					8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder
					will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
					with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
					within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
					sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly
					granted shall survive any termination of this
					License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
					remain in effect beyond the termination of this
					License shall survive.

					8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a
					patent infringement claim (excluding declatory
					judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
					Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
					against whom You file such action is referred to as
					"Participant") alleging that:

					(a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly
					or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all
					rights granted by such Participant to You under
					Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon
					60 days notice from Participant terminate
					prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
					receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing
					to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable
					royalty for Your past and future use of
					Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
					withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the
					Contributor Version against such Participant. If
					within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and
					payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in
					writing by the parties or the litigation claim is
					not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to
					You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically
					terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice
					period specified above.

					(b) any software, hardware, or device, other than
					such Participant's Contributor Version, directly or
					indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights
					granted to You by such Participant under Sections
					2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the
					date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had
					made, Modifications made by that Participant.

					8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim
					against Participant alleging that such Participant's
					Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
					any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
					license or settlement) prior to the initiation of
					patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable
					value of the licenses granted by such Participant
					under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into
					account in determining the amount or value of any
					payment or license.

					8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1
					or 8.2 above, all end user license agreements
					(excluding distributors and resellers) which have
					been validly granted by You or any distributor
					hereunder prior to termination shall survive
					termination.

					9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

					UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY,
					WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR
					OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
					OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
					CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
					LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
					INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
					CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR
					LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
					MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
					OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
					INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
					LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
					FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
					PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
					PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
					ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
					CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
					LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

					10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

					The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that
					term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995),
					consisting of "commercial computer software" and
					"commercial computer software documentation," as
					such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.
					1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
					C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),
					all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code
					with only those rights set forth herein.

					11. MISCELLANEOUS.

					This License represents the complete agreement
					concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision
					of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
					provision shall be reformed only to the extent
					necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall
					be governed by California law provisions (except to
					the extent applicable law, if any, provides
					otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law
					provisions. With respect to disputes in which at
					least one party is a citizen of, or an entity
					chartered or registered to do business in the United
					States of America, any litigation relating to this
					License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
					Federal Courts of the Northern District of
					California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
					California, with the losing party responsible for
					costs, including without limitation, court costs and
					reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The
					application of the United Nations Convention on
					Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
					expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which
					provides that the language of a contract shall be
					construed against the drafter shall not apply to
					this License.

					12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

					As between Initial Developer and the Contributors,
					each party is responsible for claims and damages
					arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
					utilization of rights under this License and You
					agree to work with Initial Developer and
					Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an
					equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall
					be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

					13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.

					Initial Developer may designate portions of the
					Covered Code as "Multiple-Licensed".
					"Multiple-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer
					permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code
					under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative
					licenses, if any, specified by the Initial Developer
					in the file described in Exhibit A.

					EXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.

					GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

					Version 3, 29 June 2007

					Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
					&lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

					Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute
					verbatim copies of this license document, but
					changing it is not allowed.

					This version of the GNU Lesser General Public
					License incorporates the terms and conditions of
					version 3 of the GNU General Public License,
					supplemented by the additional permissions listed
					below. 0. Additional Definitions.

					As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3
					of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the
					“GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General
					Public License.

					“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by
					this License, other than an Application or a
					Combined Work as defined below.

					An “Application” is any work that makes use of an
					interface provided by the Library, but which is not
					otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass
					of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
					of using an interface provided by the Library.

					A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or
					linking an Application with the Library. The
					particular version of the Library with which the
					Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
					Version”.

					The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined
					Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined
					Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
					Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
					based on the Application, and not on the Linked
					Version.

					The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined
					Work means the object code and/or source code for
					the Application, including any data and utility
					programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work
					from the Application, but excluding the System
					Libraries of the Combined Work. 1. Exception to
					Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

					You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4
					of this License without being bound by section 3 of
					the GNU GPL. 2. Conveying Modified Versions.

					If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
					modifications, a facility refers to a function or
					data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
					facility (other than as an argument passed when the
					facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of
					the modified version:

					* a) under this License, provided that you make a
					good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an
					Application does not supply the function or data,
					the facility still operates, and performs whatever
					part of its purpose remains meaningful, or * b)
					under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional
					permissions of this License applicable to that copy.

					3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library
					Header Files.

					The object code form of an Application may
					incorporate material from a header file that is part
					of the Library. You may convey such object code
					under terms of your choice, provided that, if the
					incorporated material is not limited to numerical
					parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or
					small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or
					fewer lines in length), you do both of the
					following:

					* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
					object code that the Library is used in it and that
					the Library and its use are covered by this License.
					* b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the
					GNU GPL and this license document.

					4. Combined Works.

					You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your
					choice that, taken together, effectively do not
					restrict modification of the portions of the Library
					contained in the Combined Work and reverse
					engineering for debugging such modifications, if you
					also do each of the following:

					* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
					Combined Work that the Library is used in it and
					that the Library and its use are covered by this
					License. * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a
					copy of the GNU GPL and this license document. * c)
					For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices
					during execution, include the copyright notice for
					the Library among these notices, as well as a
					reference directing the user to the copies of the
					GNU GPL and this license document. * d) Do one of
					the following: o 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding
					Source under the terms of this License, and the
					Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable
					for, and under terms that permit, the user to
					recombine or relink the Application with a modified
					version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
					Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6
					of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. o
					1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for
					linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is
					one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library
					already present on the user's computer system, and
					(b) will operate properly with a modified version of
					the Library that is interface-compatible with the
					Linked Version. * e) Provide Installation
					Information, but only if you would otherwise be
					required to provide such information under section 6
					of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such
					information is necessary to install and execute a
					modified version of the Combined Work produced by
					recombining or relinking the Application with a
					modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
					option 4d0, the Installation Information must
					accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and
					Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
					4d1, you must provide the Installation Information
					in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
					for conveying Corresponding Source.)

					5. Combined Libraries.

					You may place library facilities that are a work
					based on the Library side by side in a single
					library together with other library facilities that
					are not Applications and are not covered by this
					License, and convey such a combined library under
					terms of your choice, if you do both of the
					following:

					* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of
					the same work based on the Library, uncombined with
					any other library facilities, conveyed under the
					terms of this License. * b) Give prominent notice
					with the combined library that part of it is a work
					based on the Library, and explaining where to find
					the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

					6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
					License.

					The Free Software Foundation may publish revised
					and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
					License from time to time. Such new versions will be
					similar in spirit to the present version, but may
					differ in detail to address new problems or
					concerns.

					Each version is given a distinguishing version
					number. If the Library as you received it specifies
					that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser
					General Public License “or any later version”
					applies to it, you have the option of following the
					terms and conditions either of that published
					version or of any later version published by the
					Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
					received it does not specify a version number of the
					GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose
					any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
					ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

					If the Library as you received it specifies that a
					proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU
					Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
					proxy's public statement of acceptance of any
					version is permanent authorization for you to choose
					that version for the Library.

					the combination of Modifications made by that
					Contributor with other software (except as part of
					the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)
					under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in
					the absence of Modifications made by that
					Contributor.

					3. Distribution Obligations.

					3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered
					Software that You distribute or otherwise make
					available in Executable form must also be made
					available in Source Code form and that Source Code
					form must be distributed only under the terms of
					this License. You must include a copy of this
					License with every copy of the Source Code form of
					the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise
					make available. You must inform recipients of any
					such Covered Software in Executable form as to how
					they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
					form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
					customarily used for software exchange.

					3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You
					create or to which You contribute are governed by
					the terms of this License. You represent that You
					believe Your Modifications are Your original
					creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
					grant the rights conveyed by this License.

					3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in
					each of Your Modifications that identifies You as
					the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
					remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark
					notices contained within the Covered Software, or
					any notices of licensing or any descriptive text
					giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial
					Developer.

					3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not
					offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
					Source Code form that alters or restricts the
					applicable version of this License or the recipients
					rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
					charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
					liability obligations to one or more recipients of
					Covered Software. However, you may do so only on
					Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
					Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
					absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
					indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
					alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
					Developer and every Contributor for any liability
					incurred by the Initial Developer or such
					Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
					indemnity or liability terms You offer.

					3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may
					distribute the Executable form of the Covered
					Software under the terms of this License or under
					the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
					contain terms different from this License, provided
					that You are in compliance with the terms of this
					License and that the license for the Executable form
					does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients
					rights in the Source Code form from the rights set
					forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
					Software in Executable form under a different
					license, You must make it absolutely clear that any
					terms which differ from this License are offered by
					You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
					Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
					Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
					liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
					Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

					3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by
					combining Covered Software with other code not
					governed by the terms of this License and distribute
					the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
					You must make sure the requirements of this License
					are fulfilled for the Covered Software.

					4. Versions of the License.

					4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the
					initial license steward and may publish revised
					and/or new versions of this License from time to
					time. Each version will be given a distinguishing
					version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3,
					no one other than the license steward has the right
					to modify this License.

					4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue
					to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
					Software available under the terms of the version of
					the License under which You originally received the
					Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes
					a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it
					from being distributed or otherwise made available
					under any subsequent version of the License, You
					must distribute and make the Covered Software
					available under the terms of the version of the
					License under which You originally received the
					Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to
					use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
					Software available under the terms of any subsequent
					version of the License published by the license
					steward.

					4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial
					Developer and You want to create a new license for
					Your Original Software, You may create and use a
					modified version of this License if You: (a) rename
					the license and remove any references to the name of
					the license steward (except to note that the license
					differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make
					it clear that the license contains terms which
					differ from this License.

					5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS
					PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS,
					WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
					IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
					THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
					MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
					NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY
					AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.
					SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
					RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
					CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
					SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF
					WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS
					LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
					AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

					6. TERMINATION.

					6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder
					will terminate automatically if You fail to comply
					with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
					within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
					Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in
					effect beyond the termination of this License shall
					survive.

					6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim
					(excluding declaratory judgment actions) against
					Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial
					Developer or Contributor against whom You assert
					such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging
					that the Participant Software (meaning the
					Contributor Version where the Participant is a
					Contributor or the Original Software where the
					Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
					indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all
					rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such
					Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial
					Developer is not the Participant) and all
					Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this
					License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant
					terminate prospectively and automatically at the
					expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if
					within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim
					with respect to the Participant Software against
					such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
					a written agreement with Participant.

					6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1
					or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been
					validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder
					prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to
					You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

					7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES
					AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
					NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
					INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
					DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
					ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
					INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
					DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
					LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF
					GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR
					MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
					OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
					INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
					LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
					FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
					PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
					PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
					ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
					CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND
					LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

					8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software
					is a commercial item, as that term is defined in 48
					C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial
					computer software (as that term is defined at 48
					C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer
					software documentation as such terms are used in 48
					C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48
					C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through
					227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
					Users acquire Covered Software with only those
					rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
					clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR,
					DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
					Government rights in computer software under this
					License.

					9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the
					complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.
					If any provision of this License is held to be
					unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only
					to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This
					License shall be governed by the law of the
					jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
					the Original Software (except to the extent
					applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
					excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law
					provisions. Any litigation relating to this License
					shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts
					located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a
					notice contained within the Original Software, with
					the losing party responsible for costs, including,
					without limitation, court costs and reasonable
					attorneys fees and expenses. The application of the
					United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
					International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
					Any law or regulation which provides that the
					language of a contract shall be construed against
					the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
					agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
					with the United States export administration
					regulations (and the export control laws and
					regulation of any other countries) when You use,
					distribute or otherwise make available any Covered
					Software.

					10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial
					Developer and the Contributors, each party is
					responsible for claims and damages arising, directly
					or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights
					under this License and You agree to work with
					Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute
					such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing
					herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute
					any admission of liability.

					NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON
					DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) The code
					released under the CDDL shall be governed by the
					laws of the State of California (excluding
					conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating
					to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction
					of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
					California and the state courts of the State of
					California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
					California.

					About Identifying and Non-Identifying Relationships
				</title>

				<para>

					You can create relationships between tables. For
					example, a typical one-to-many relationship might
					describe how invoices and invoice line items relate
					to each other. The relationship might indicate that
					the invoice_line table is a child of the invoice
					table, and every row in the invoice_line table
					relates to exactly one row in the invoice table.

				</para>

				<para>

					You can create identifying and non-identifying
					relationships:

				<itemizedlist>

					<listitem>

						<para>

							In an identifying relationship, the child
							table cannot be uniquely identified without
							the parent.

						</para>

					</listitem>

					<listitem>

						<para>

							In a non-identifying relationship, the child
							can be identified independently of the
							parent.

						</para>

					</listitem>

				</itemizedlist>

				<para>

					You could choose to create the invoice and invoice
					line relationship from the previous example as
					either an identifying or non-identifying
					relationship.

				</para>

				<itemizedlist>

					<listitem>

						<para>

							If you create an identifying relationship,
							an invoice line cannot be uniquely
							identified without also knowing the invoice
							number it belongs to. For example, assume
							that invoice line numbers always start at 0
							or 1 within each invoice. The same line
							numbers will appear in different invoices -
							each invoice will have a line 0, line 1,
							line 2, etc.

							If you create a non-identifying
							relationship, an invoice can be uniquely

							each invoice line has its own unique

							example, invoice_line_id is referred to as a
							"surrogate key," because it's just a made-up
							number which has no special meaning in terms

											<para>

												When manipulating data

												INSERT, UPDATE, and
												DELETE statements), the
												foreign key constraints
												created by
												Power*Architect are used
												to ensure data integrity
												between the two tables.
												The deferrability
												options control when
												these constraints are
												enforced.

											</para>

											<para>

												Within the context of a
												transaction, deferred
												constraints are not
												checked until the
												transaction is
												committed, while
												immediate constraints
												are checked at the time
												the INSERT, UPDATE, or
												DELETE statement is
												issued (in the middle of
												the transaction). This
												means that if you are
												using immediate
												constraints, you must be
												careful about the order
												in which data is
												changed. With deferred
												constraint checking, you
												can make changes in any
												order as long as all
												constraints have been
												satisfied by the time
												you commit.

											</para>

											<para>

												For databases that
												support deferred and
												immediate constraint
												checking, each
												transaction can specify
												whether to defer
												constraint checks or
												carry them out
												immediately. If a
												transaction does not
												specify this option,
												each deferrable foreign
												key constraint is
												evaluated according to
												its "initially
												immediate" or "initially
												deferred" option. On the
												other hand, constraints
												marked as "not
												deferrable" will always
												be checked immediately
												regardless of the
												transaction's setting.

														the format
														&lt;variable_name:default_value&gt;
														(to include a
														default value)
														or
														&lt;variable_name&gt;
														(if you don't
														want to include
														a default

											</itemizedlist>

											<para>
												For example, the

											<para>
												When you create a

												URL
												"jdbc:sqlserver://:1433",
												where 1433 is the
												default port value.
												Since SQL Server
												databases listen to port
												1433 by default, it
												makes sense to include
												this value in the
												template. When you're
												creating the actual

												can change the port

				<title>Defining the JDBC Driver</title>

				<para>
					Whether you are adding a new database platform to
					Power*Architect or want to use one of the
					pre-configured platforms, the last step in setting
					up a database type is to locate the JAR file (or
					files) that contain the JDBC drivers for the
					database platform.
				</para>

				<para>
					Note: Remember, at this point you are just telling
					Power*Architect where the drivers are. You must set
					up a database connection in order to connect to a
					specific database server (for more information, see "<xref linkend="setup_database.connections"/>").
				</para>

				<para>
					Unlike most applications, which need a distinct
					driver program to communicate with each type of
					database, Power*Architect uses Java-based drivers.
					These drivers normally come from the database vendor
					in the form of JAR (Java Archive) files. JAR files
					are an extension to the file format used by
					PKZip/WinZip archives.
				</para>

				<para>
					Most database platforms provide drivers that are
					fully backward compatible. This means that it is
					best to use the newest driver available, regardless
					of the software version on the specific database
					server you intend to connect to. One exception to
					this is the Oracle database. It is important to
					match the major version number of your JDBC driver
					with the major version number of the Oracle database
					server you connect to. For example, if you are
					connecting to an Oracle 10g database, use the latest
					Oracle 10g driver. If you are connecting to an
					Oracle 9i database, use the Oracle 9i driver.

		<title>Reverse Engineering a Data Model</title>

			You can use reverse engineering to obtain a data model from
			an existing database, then work with the data model in
			Power*Architect. You can also use Power*Architect to create
			an upgrade script for the original database (for more

		</para>

		<para>
			You can also use reverse engineering for data warehouse
			design, where your objective is to unify several data models

			To do this, you would typically reverse engineer one table
			at a time from several different source systems, then make
			modifications in Power*Architect, using the playpen. You can
			then forward engineer the new data warehouse data model to a
			new, separate database (for more information, see "<xref linkend="forward_engineer"/>", then use an ETL tool to transfer the data from the source
			systems to the data warehouse.

		<title>Forward Engineering a Data Model</title>

		<para>
			A key design principle of Power*Architect is that the data
			models you create always remain generic. This allows you to
			use the same data model with a variety of database
			platforms. You can then use forward engineering to transform
			a data model for a specific database platform.
		</para>

		<para>
			When you forward engineer a data model, Power*Architect
			creates a physical model that represents the idealized
			generic model as closely as possible, given the constraints
			of the target system. Power*Architect then creates a SQL
			Script that you can run to place the components of the data
			model into a database.
		</para>

		<para>
			It is important to note that Power*Architect creates the
			structure of the target database only and does not create
			the actual database. Before using forward engineering, you
			must create the target database. You would typically do this
			using the administrative tools provided for the database
			platform.

		<title>SQLRunner</title>

		<para>
			SQLRunner is a "fall-back" tool that lets you work at the
			raw SQL command level. This is an advanced topic and should
			only be used by those familiar with the intricacies of SQL
			commands and the details of your database.
		</para>

		<para>
			SQLRunner was written by Ian Darwin, and is distributed
			under a liberal free-software, open-source license which
			permits its inclusion in programs such as Power*Architect.
		</para>

		<para>
			SQLRunner is started from the menu entry under the Tools
			menu, and begins with the GUI window shown below. The first
			thing you should do is select which database connection you
			wish to use. The list of Connections is the same as the main
			program uses, as set up in the JDBC Connections window.
		</para>

		<para>
			The basic steps to using SQLRunner are to type a command in
			the top (SQL Command) window and click the Run button; the
			results are displayed in the bottom (SQL Results) window. To
			save you some typing, there is a "Statement Template"
			mechanism that will insert a template for SELECT, INSERT or
			UPDATE SQL statements (just select the template you want and
			click "Apply Template" and the template will replace the
			current Input Statement).

			SQL Statements are entered one at a time, can be more than
			one line long, and need not end with a semicolon. These
			statements are not interpreted by SQLRunner itself, so
			anything that the given database and driver accepts can be
			used. For example, with Oracle, you can use PL*SQL
			statements. With most drivers you should be able to use
			stored procedures. Each SQL statement is executed in its own
			transaction context, that is, changes are committed
			immediately (so be careful!).

			<title>Output Formats</title>

			<para>
				There are several output modes for the display of SQL
				"select" results: text, SQL, HTML, XML, and Table.
				Output from the escape commands are always displayed as
				plain text. Text mode is the default, and is primarily a
				raw display format. SQL output is most useful with the
				output of a SELECT statement; it will generate SQL that
				will attempt to re-create the data in another database.
				HTML mode generates an HTML table to display the results
				of a Select. XML format is similar but may be used for
				exporting data into other applications. Finally, table
				mode provides a friendlier interface which ensures all
				of the columns are lined up properly. In this mode, it
				is even possible to rearrange the columns by dragging
				them.
			</para>

			<para>
				For example, with SQL mode selected, a "select * from
				anecdotes" (a table in a sample bookstore web
				site&apos;s database, used to display a casual quotation
				about books) looked like this:

			</para>

			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata fileref="doc/images/sqlrunner_output.png"
						format="PNG" width="4in" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
			<para>
				This could, as you can see, be used to create a SQL
				script to re-create the contents of the database. In
				fact, some developers use SQLRunner primarily for this
				purpose: to create stable test databases from "live"
				data that was created by their application.
			</para>

			<para>
				You can view this same data in HTML just by changing the
				Format selection to HTML and clicking the Run button
				again:
			</para>

			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata
						fileref="doc/images/sqlrunner_output_2.png" format="PNG" width="4in" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
			<para>
				When copied and pasted into an HTML file and viewed in a
				browser, the output looked like this:
			</para>

			<mediaobject>
				<imageobject>
					<imagedata
						fileref="doc/images/sqlrunner_html_output.png" format="PNG" width="4in" />
				</imageobject>
			</mediaobject>
			<para>
				With a bit of formatting, or even a CSS style sheet,
				this HTML page could be made quite usable.
			</para>

			<para>
				SQLRunner is not perfect, but it is adequate for many
				purposes involving direct use of SQL.
