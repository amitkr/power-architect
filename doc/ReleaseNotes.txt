Power*Architect Release Notes

IMPORTANT NOTE to users upgrading from pre-0.9.x versions of the Architect:
 We have made incompatible modifications to the PL.INI file which specifies
 your database connections.  After upgrading to this version, you will need
 to set up database connection types for all your databases in the user
 preferences dialog, then edit the properties on your existing connections
 to associate them with one of the configured database types.  This will
 also apply to connections within projects you have saved with older versions
 of the Architect.  We apologize for the inconvenience, but the benefits will
 outweigh the costs!

0.9.8
*Fixed a bug where re-profiling a cancelled profile would freeze the GUI until
the profiling was finished.

0.9.7

*Fixed a bug with handling of automatic cascading primary keys in multi-level
 identifying relationships.
*Fixed a bug which was causing the Architect to save corrupt project files.
 This bug was triggered by adding and removing a column from the primary key.
*Further enhanced the profile manager so it is possible to run profiles
 multiple times per session.
*Made it possible to add new database connection types from within the GUI.
*Corrected the JDBC URL template for IBM DB2.  If upgrading, to obtain this fix,
 you have to remove the DB2 database type from the user preferences dialog,
 then restart the Architect.
*Corrected an error in the user guide relating to the creation of FK
 relationships.
*And more!

0.9.6

Initial open-source release!

*Added the ability to create ETL jobs for Pentaho Data Integration (formerly
 Kettle)
*A number of bug fixes
*Replaced the icon set with the free FAMFAMFAM icon set, which looks much
 nicer than the Java Look-and-feel Graphics Repository we were using before.


0.9.5

Internal release, not publically promoted.

*Major bugfix: We now escape all characters in the project file which are
 impossible to represent in XML.  It is entirely possible for these characters
 to sneak into a profile result.


0.9.4

*Added PDF Export feature under File menu
*Added MySQL compatibility
*Improved DDL Generator Warnings interface to include a better UI and a "quick
 fix" feature which guesses the new value
*Improved Profiling GUI to include a profile manager for browsing, searching,
 and deleting existing profile data in the project
*Added index support for tables, forward engineering, and reverse engineering
 (supports unique and non-unique indices)
*Completely reworked the strategy for loading JDBC driver classes.  New features
 include:
  +A better GUI for configuring database connections
  +Users can create new database connection types within the Architect (previously
   this required editing PL.INI by hand)
  +Can have multiple versions of the same driver in use at the same time (required
   for Oracle 8i/9i/10g)
  +It is now possible to ship Architect distributions with JDBC drivers built in
  +There is now a place where we will be able to allow much more user configuration
   per database type in the future
  +Unfortunately, this change is not backward compatible with the 0.0.x versions
   of the Architect PL.INI file.
*Replaced the old tree icons with much nicer-looking new ones

0.0.91

*Added in a new function: Profiling
	-Displays the distrobution of a column's data in a pie chart 
	-Displays useful profiling information such as maximum and minimum values
	 of a column
	-Shows the most frequent n values within the column (the number of results
	 to display is configurable within project settings)
	-Ability to sort the information by column attribute 
	-Easy to use search function to narrow down results 
	-Save profiling data in csv, pdf or html formats 
*Rectify "Save" filename handling: the file suffix is used in preference to the
 selected File Selection Filter. 
*Fixed the "Locked Column throwing silent exceptions" bug.  When moving a
 imported column to another table, it did *not show the warning error.
*Fixed null count problem in sql server
*Fixed minor type mapping problem in the oracle ddl generator
*Change from directly using the Swing Browser to display the manual as a form of
 Help, to using Sun's JavaHelp API. 
*Added an Index file to the help file.
