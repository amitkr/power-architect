Power*Architect Release Notes

IMPORTANT NOTE to users upgrading from 0.0.x versions of the Architect:
 We have made incompatible modifications to the PL.INI file which specifies
 your database connections.  After upgrading to this version, you will need
 to set up database connection types for all your databases in the user
 preferences dialog, then edit the properties on your existing connections
 to associate them with one of the configured database types.  This will
 also apply to connections within projects you have saved with older versions
 of the Architect.  We apologize for the inconvenience, but the benefits will
 outweigh the costs!

1.0.0 rc1

*Added PDF Export feature under File menu
*Added MySQL compatibility
*Improved DDL Generator Warnings interface to include a better UI and a "quick fix" feature which guesses the new value
*Improved Profiling GUI to include a profile manager for browsing, searching, and deleting existing profile data in the project
*Added index support for tables, forward engineering, and reverse engineering (supports unique and non-unique indices)
*Completely reworked the strategy for loading JDBC driver classes.  New features include:
 +A better GUI for configuring database connections
 +Users can create new database connection types within the Architect (previously this required editing PL.INI by hand)
 +Can have multiple versions of the same driver in use at the same time (required for Oracle 8i/9i/10g)
 +It is now possible to ship Architect distributions with JDBC drivers built in
 +There is now a place where we will be able to allow much more user configuration per database type in the future
 +Unfortunately, this change is not backward compatible with the 0.0.x versions of the Architect PL.INI file.
*Replaced the old tree icons with much nicer-looking new ones

0.0.91

*Added in a new function: Profiling
	-Displays the distrobution of a column's data in a pie chart 
	-Displays useful profiling information such as maximum and minimum values of a column
	-Shows the most frequent n values within the column (the number of results to display is configurable 		within project settings)
	-Ability to sort the information by column attribute 
	-Easy to use search function to narrow down results 
	-Save profiling data in csv, pdf or html formats 
*Rectify "Save" filename handling: the file suffix is used in preference to the selected File Selection Filter. 
*Fixed the "Locked Column throwing silent exceptions" bug.  When moving a imported column to another table, it did *not show the warning error.
*Fixed null count problem in sql server
*Fixed minor type mapping problem in the oracle ddl generator
*Change from directly using the Swing Browser to display the manual as a form of Help, to using Sun's JavaHelp API.
