Architect Development Wish List

$Id$

Are you interested in getting started on Power*Architect
development, but don't know where to begin?

We're glad you asked. :)

This is a wish list of stuff we would absolutely love to
do ourselves, but haven't (yet?) found the time to tackle.
If you're itching to get your hands dirty, take a look at
this list.  If a solution springs to mind, just go for it
and post a patch to the developers mailing list.  If
something on this list appeals to you, but you don't know
where to begin, post a note to the mailing list and someone
will be happy to point you in the right direction.

Before tackling anything on this list, please read the
DEVELOPERS file, which includes important instructions about
how to check out the latest copy of the code from our source
code repository, how to use the Architect's build system,
and other development bootstrapping information.

Now, on to the list:

Code Cleanup and Refactoring

* CPD (the copy-paste detector) reveals a number of places
  that need a common superclass factored out.  Run the
  pmd-cpd target in build.xml for a report, then pick one
  and go for it!
  
* The PMD basic ruleset points out a number of potential
  programming problems in the Architect.  Pick your favourite
  and propose a fix on the developers list.  Run the pmd
  target in build.xml to generate a current copy of the report.


Bugs, bugs, bugs

* There is no shortage of stuff in our bug repository.  Take
  a gander and see if there's anything in there (be it a
  bug or an enhancement request) you're interested in
  tackling.

* Ad-hoc testing is a really important part of quality
  control, too.  If you just don't think there's anything
  interesting in the bug database already, please tell us
  what you're smoking, and where to get some. Then, you can
  always try to find new issues by using the app yourself.
