TODO list for Profiling.

Have a "Don't Save Profiles" option in Architect User Settings.

More unit tests!!
	Ensure load/save project still OK

Window menu in ArchitectFrame to show/hide ProfileManagerView

Clean up ProfileRowComponent GUI (JGoodies not being used correctly?).

MAKE LAST FEW NEW CONTROLS WORK:
	Stop button
	refresh profile
	Status label (%d of %d rows)

ProfileRowComponent - double click to show just that one table result
in its own ProfileResultsViewer window.  Select Multiple Rows and
"View All" button would show just those ones in its own PRV window
(may be easy to implement using existing Filter stuff)

Have multiple profiles of the same table at different times.

-----
Have Project Close shut down running threads.
