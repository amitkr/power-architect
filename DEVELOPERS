How To Check Out Sources

To check out the Power*Architect source from SVN to Eclipse start Eclipse and 
create a new project. Select the SVN wizard and click next. If you don't
have SVN available on your version of Eclipse you can get Subclipse. For 
installation instructions for Subclipse see http://subclipse.tigris.org/install.html. 
Create a new repository to check out Power*Architect from. The URL for the new
repository is http://power-architect.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/. Once the URL 
has been entered press next. To check out all of the source files for Power*Architect
select the root of the tree and press next. Set the name of the project if you
want it to have a unique name, the default is architect, and select to check 
out the head revision for the most recent changes and click finish.

For users who wish to check out the source using a command line version of SVN 
you can use the command:
svn checkout http://power-architect.googlecode.com/svn/trunk power-architect

Subscribe To Power*Architect Mailing Lists

There are two mailing lists for developers for Power*Architect which are hosted 
on Google Groups. The first mailing list is the developers mailing list. The
developers list is for asking questions, giving comments and suggestions, or 
any other concers that you may have while making modifications. The developer 
mailing list is at http://groups.google.com/group/architect-developers. The 
second mailing list is for commits to Power*Architect. The commits mailing 
list is emailed every time a commit is done to the Power*Architect repository 
with a comment about what was changed and a list of the modifications. The 
commits mailing list is at http://groups.google.com/group/architect-commits.

Coding Standards.


We mainly use Sun's conventions for coding standards which are described here:
http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/

Our exceptions to Sun's rules, and some notes:

2.2 We don't use gnumake, so ignore the GNUmakefile thing

3.1.1 The non-javadoc introductory comment should now be the BSD license for 
	Architect and the SQLPower library it dependson

3.1.3 (4) Always put the log4j Logger declaration first, followed by a blank 
	line. No need to comment it.

4. Our tab size is currently 4, but we should all set our editors to use 
	spaces instead of tabs.  4 is not a standard tab size (8 is usual), and 
	tab stops of 4 will frustrate outside people trying to work with (or 
	simply read over) our code. 

4.1 80 characters is a bit of an old-fashioned limitation, but excessively 
	long lines are difficult to read.  Use your judgment here.

6.2 Sun's guide recommends declaring variables only at the beginning of a 
	block.  I disagree: Code is more manageable and maintainable when variables 
	are declared as late as possible within a block. 

6.3 I agree that you should initialize a variable when it's declared whenever 
	possible.  However, when there is some logic associated with how to initialize 
	a value, it is best to declare it and leave it uninitialized at first, then in 
	each branch that follows, assign a value to the variable.  This way, the 
	compiler will ensure that every possible path through the code ends up 
	initializing the variable. Example: 

	int foo;
	if (bar < 10) {
    	foo = 12;
	} else if (bar == 20) {
    	foo = 9;
	} else {
    	foo = bar * 3;
	}
	System.out.println(foo);    // This line will not compile unless foo has 
								// definitely been initialized (in this example, it has) 

7.4 The last part shows an example of unacceptable code:

	if (condition)
    	statement;

	We also consider this unacceptable.  However, we have a similar construction 
	which is acceptable: The "guard" idiom. 

	if (condition) return;

	or 

	if (condition) break;

	or

	if (condition) continue;

	This is only acceptable (in fact, it is the preferred form for expressing 
	the guard concept) if the return, break, or continue statement occurs on 
	the same line as the if.  When the condition is long enough to warrant a 
	line break before the return, break, or continue statement, you must use braces: 

	// WRONG--conditionally executed code is on next line but not within braces
	if (condition || condition2 || condition3)
    	return;

	// CORRECT--Always use braces when the conditionally-executed code is not 
	// on the same line as the if
	if (condition || condition2 || condition3) {
    	return;
	}


7.9 Our preferred variable name for an exception in a catch block is "e" or 
	"ex", not "e1" as Eclipse likes to autogenerate.

	Our preferred name for an event object in an event handler is also "e".  
	Therefore, you will often see catch blocks naming their exceptions "ex" 
	in Swing-related code to avoid confusion and naming conflicts. 

9. (Interface naming) Additionally, avoid the temptation to use the word 
	"Interface" in an interface name, and the similar temptation to begin 
	an interface name with an I.  Interface names should be given the cleanest, 
	most natural names possible.  For instance, if you're creating an interface 
	and implementation for a beverage frobbing aparatus, you should name the 
	interface BeverageFrobber, and the implementation class BeverageFrobberImpl.  
	If there will be several implementations that would benefit from extending 
	an abstract base implementation, you would still create a BeverageFrobber 
	interface, then create an abstract class AbstractBeverageFrobber, and extend 
	it to the concrete classes named for their particular purpose 
	(BlendingBeverageFrobber, SippingBeverageFrobber, PouringBeverageFrobber, and so on). 
	
How To Use The Build File

The following section assumes that Eclipse is being used for development.

To build Power*Architect from the source files Apache Ant version 1.7 or higher
is required. See the following sub-section on how to install Apache Ant version 1.7 for 
Eclipse. Once Ant 1.7 is installed Power*Architect can be run by using the
build.xml file. To run Power*Architect open the build.xml file and select the
target named run in the outline. Right click on the run target and select 
Ant Build from the Run As menu option. Another target of interest is the alltest
target. This target will run the different test suites available with Power*Architect.
The alltest target can be run by right clicking on the alltest target and selecting
the Ant Build from the Run As menu option.

	How To Install Apache Ant For Eclipse
	
	Apache Ant is available at http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi. To install Ant
	1.7 into Eclipse first unzip and install Ant to your local machine. Then under
	Eclipse's user preferences select the Ant runtime item in the list of preferences
	on the left. Click on the Ant Home button and select the folder that you installed
	Ant 1.7 into. Then click ok and Eclipse will use the new Ant.
	
The Wishlist

For developers new to Power*Architect that want to start making contributions to 
Power*Architect there is a wishlist included with the source code that the developers
have put together.
